# CapstoneAA05

# Preamble

Amazon Alexa is a versatile virtual assistant that can also control several smart devices. Applications such as home automation, remote monitoring and to-do-list execution can be integrated with Alexa. Smart cameras are one of the most useful artificial intelligence (AI)-powered devices and by taking advantage of AI, one can determine abnormalities. In this project, using Alexa Skills Kit, applications will be developed that are AI-based and use integrated sensors to remotely monitor and control the states of the in-house devices.

# Objective

-To design, develop and test an integrated system for monitoring and control of various components such as appliances and gadgets as per the specifications. -The typical applications (such as temperature control, water leak detection, motion detection and power usage) within a typical house are to be monitored and controlled in one system and effectively communicate with remote devices using AI-powered Alexa - To simulate (if needed) and validate the workings of the monitor/controller through the combination of software simulation and embedded implementation.
Partial Specifications

The monitoring and control system to be implemented should: (a) use Arduino (or similar) board in sensing and data acquisition, (b) in real- time monitor via wireless technologies at desktop computer and smart phone, (c) use Java in programming and Android/iPhone-based display, (d) and build intelligence and integrate with Alexa.
Suggested Approach

- Study the literature on Arduino-based (or appropriate) sensors, wireless control, and monitoring.
- Learn Alexa Skills Kit to build and publish skills for Alexa focusing on home automation
- Research on technology for wireless device communication with attention given to radio channels, energy-efficient yet reliable communication. Decide on the wireless system.
- Design a data acquisition/monitoring subsystem and develop software for the data acquisition/processing of subsystems.
-Use modular approach in design/test and then integrate.
-Design/develop the GUI with as many user-selectable inputs
- Arduino programming and APPS development.
-Test the integrated system for typical/extreme utility conditions which will be done through simulation and some implementation.
Group Responsibilities

Study wireless communication systems, design/develop the technical specifications required for the system prototype under consideration, implement and test of the entire system with the above objectives. Follow the project management plan carefully and thoroughly. Responsible for the demo and project report.
